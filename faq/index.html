                <p>Model United Nations (MUN) is an educational simulation and academic activity in which participants simulate the activities of the United Nations and other international organizations. In a Model UN conference, participants take on the roles of diplomats from different countries, adopting the perspectives and policies of those countries on various topics that permeate the world we live in. In a conference, they will engage in discussions, negotiations, and debates in an attempt to find solutions to complex global issues. These conferences aim to enhance participants’ understanding of international relations, diplomacy, negotiation, public speaking, research, and most importantly, critical thinking skills. </p>
