Walking up onto the stage and speaking before the podium in front of a large audience years back was a feat that she will always remember.

Through Model UN, Sarah was provided opportunities that broadened her knowledge on international relations, and was introduced to what diplomacy entails. It is her greatest aspiration to kindle similar experiences within all delegates through the establishment of CANMUN. Outside of Model UN, Sarah can be found coaching debate, playing volleyball, or catching up on sleep due to the vigorous IB environment. Beyond all, Sarah welcomes all delegates, wishing everyone a memorable and rewarding conference experience.</p>

His first conference being SSUNS 2022. It was an amazing experience that marked his memory and allowed him to make lifelong friends.

Throughout Calvin’s MUN career, he has had the opportunity to attend conferences across Canada which further anchored his passion for diplomacy and debate. He is excited to share his love for MUN and he hopes that your experience at CANMUN 2024 is as everlasting as his. Apart from the fiery debates during committee sessions, Calvin can be found watching movies at midnight and spending sleepless nights exploring the host city of a MUN conference. Outside of MUN, Calvin is probably busy acting as a tour guide for his friends when they visit him in Montreal, watching kdramas/cdramas or simply taking a nice long walk downtown. Lastly, If anyone ever needs someone to explore the city of Toronto with, feel free to reachout!</p>

Before he knew it, Model UN became one of Alan’s major interests. He finds joy in meeting new people, learning about world politics, debating issues, and of course, the travel opportunities. Outside of Model UN, Alan spends his time working out, laughing at memes, working for his lifeguard certifications, hanging out with friends, and studying for all his IB courses.

Despite such a sleep depriving experience, her curiosity for Model UN only ever expanded and eventually, her commitment towards it as well. She would have never anticipated for herself to pursue this experience thus far, though she is abundantly grateful that she did. Outside of Model UN, Kaitlyn spends her time creating fun memories with peers, sketching, and listening to her Spotify playlists on loop.</p>

Outside of Model UN, Jennifer enjoys speedcubing, playing volleyball & badminton, and eating all the orange-flavored mentos she can find.

He also has met some amazing people at some of these conferences that strive for success, which makes him more enthusiastic at conferences. He wishes that delegates attending the first ever iteration of CANMUN have an enjoyable, and pleasant experience. In his free time, he likes to spend time playing basketball, spending time with family & friends, and procrastinating his school work. </p>

He wasn't used to public speaking as an introverted child, but the MUN club provided him with an opportunity to practice. His first Model UN experience provided him with a wonderful one-of-a-kind experience in which he learnt and gained so much knowledge on international relations and policies, as well as producing numerous creative solutions to global concerns. It provided him with a fantastic opportunity to learn and improve his public speaking skills while meeting and building memories with really unique people. He feels that delegates will have a wonderful and interesting experience through CANMUN, whether they are novices like him or advanced. Shrey spends his free time outside of Model UN hanging out with friends, watching shows, or finishing the work burden required by participating in the IB programme. </p>

When he attended his first Model UN conference, he was completely astounded by the world of Model UN. Whilst he lacked experience and confidence to perform well during his first Model UN conference, many people along his way led him to end up truly enjoying the conference. He hopes all delegates attending this year’s CANMUN meet new people both inside and outside the conference room and forge lifelong bonds. Outside of MUN, Yadusharan enjoys sim-racing and reading in his free time.</p>

Public speaking and conferences were intimidating. But last year, she decided to test her limits and try it out and found herself actually enjoying it. It improved her public speaking skills and confidence levels. Outside of MUN, she can be found slacking off or planning the greatest academic comeback (which should hopefully be occurring soon). She looks forward to CANMUN and meeting all the delegates and having a great time. </p>

Due to his introverted nature, the thought of participating in MUN was unimaginable. Although Model UN was strenuous, the friendships that were developed and the crisis committees' unpredictable character made it worthwhile. Aside from Model UN, Tommy can be found starting another Korean drama, listening to beabadoobee or trying to fix his horrible sleep schedule. All in all, he sends his best wishes to all delegates and hopes to see them all in CANMUN 2023 for an unforgettable conference!</p>
