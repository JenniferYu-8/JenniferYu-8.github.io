            <h2>Committee Description</h2>
            <p>The European Union (EU), established in the wake of World War II, is a formidable political and economic alliance of 27 European nations. It originated from a profound commitment to ensuring enduring peace and cooperation on the continent. Over time, the EU's mission has expanded beyond its historical context, embracing a singular market, cohesive policies, and collective action on global issues like climate change and security.</p><br>
            <p>Central to its ethos is the facilitation of unrestricted movement of goods, services, capital, and people, fostering economic growth and innovation. The EU harmonizes standards, empowers businesses, and enriches the lives of its citizens through its cohesive approach.</p><br>
            <p>With its distinct institutions, including the European Parliament and the European Commission, the EU operates as a unique platform for collaborative decision-making and the advancement of shared interests. It assumes a significant role in international diplomacy and trade, advocating for its members and contributing to worldwide development.</p><br>
            <p>In essence, the EU exemplifies an unparalleled experiment in regional integration, encapsulating aspirations of unity, diversity, and collective prosperity, and serves as a beacon of hope for a peaceful and prosperous future.</p><br><br>

                    <h3>Topic 1 - Addressing Cybersecurity Challenges in the European Digital Market</h3>
                    <p>The European digital economy faces major cybersecurity concerns in an interconnected world that requires our attention. The Committee will provide a forum for in-depth discussion of these concerns, which will range from data breaches and identity theft to ransomware assaults and state-sponsored cyber espionage. Delegates will be able to offer comprehensive and innovative solutions aimed at strengthening cybersecurity measures, improving information exchange and cooperation among European nations, and forging strong public-private partnerships.</p><br>
                    <p>Delegates will delve into the formulation and implementation of robust policies, regulations, and best practices to preserve digital infrastructure, protect personal data, and ensure the security of important sectors such as finance, healthcare, and transportation during committee sessions. The discussions will also look at the influence of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing on cybersecurity. Delegates will contribute to the establishment of a resilient and secure European digital economy by tackling the risks and vulnerabilities associated with these technologies.</p><br>
                    <p>Furthermore, the committee will emphasize the importance of boosting public awareness and encouraging digital literacy in order to provide individuals and organizations with the tools they need to traverse the digital terrain safely. Delegates will discuss measures for educating the public about cyber dangers, supporting responsible digital behaviour, and improving European societies' overall cybersecurity posture. The committee will also emphasize the need of international cooperation and information sharing in combating transnational cybercrime, fostering trust and collaboration among states, and ensuring a secure and linked digital environment.</p><br><br>

                    <h3>Topic 2 - Promoting Sustainable Business Practices and Circular Economy in the EU</h3>
                    <p>The urgency of combating climate change and environmental degradation needs a focused conversation within the European Union on supporting sustainable business practices and expanding the circular economy. The Model United Nations Committee will provide a forum for delegates to examine new ideas and collaborative approaches to fostering sustainability, driving green initiatives, and transitioning from linear economic models to circular systems.</p><br>
                    <p>Participants will delve into the importance of pushing firms to adopt sustainable practices that prioritize environmental responsibility during committee meetings. This involves using renewable energy sources, using environmentally friendly technologies, and incorporating sustainable concepts into their operations. Delegates will look at how government laws, incentives, and voluntary initiatives might encourage enterprises to adopt sustainable business practices.</p><br>
                    <p>The circular economy concept will be a prominent focus of the discussions, as delegates investigate methods to reduce waste output while increasing reuse, recycling, and repurposing of materials. The group will assess the obstacles and opportunities connected with applying circular economy ideas in diverse industries such as manufacturing, agriculture, and consumer goods. Delegates will also discuss the economic and social ramifications of sustainable business practices, with a focus on inclusive growth, job creation, and fair labour practices.</p><br>
                    <p>Furthermore, the committee will emphasise the link between sustainable practices and the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. It will emphasise the importance of concerted efforts to integrate sustainability measures with the SDGs, fostering synergies, and guaranteeing a comprehensive approach to the EU's sustainable future.</p><br><br>

It has also allowed him to connect with like minded individuals, and learn more about current and historical world issues. Outside of Model UN, Hanz enjoys reading, spending time with friends, playing basketball, and programming. He also enjoys learning languages and is working to improve his Mandarin and Tagalog.
