            <h2>Committee Description</h2>
            <p>The year is 1789, and trouble is brewing in France's Ancien Régime. Financial crisis, famine, and an out-of-touch monarch are fueling a dangerous situation. In an urgent attempt to quell the brewing storm, King Louis XVI has summoned the États Généraux—an assembly of French subjects that first convened nearly five centuries before 1789. As delegates representing the three Estates, you must discuss and debate your solutions, which must then receive the royal seal of approval to pass into legislature.</p><br>
            <p>Your role as delegates involves weighing the clashing philosophies of the Enlightenment and the Middle Ages, including topics such as feudalism, taxation, and enfranchisement. By delving into the workings of this centuries-old committee, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of the present-day problems that plague our world.</p><br><br>

            <div class="flex-container-topics">
                <div class="flex-child-topic">
                    <h3>Topic 1 - Taxation, Debt, and Fiscal Policy</h3>
                    <p>The French financial system is in its darkest hour. War, foreign interventions, and the lavish lifestyles of the monarchy have resulted in an overwhelming pile of debt and a completely depleted treasury. The current fiscal policy unfairly places this burden on the poor, who are already struggling to make ends meet. Under Topic I, delegates of the États Généraux will devise a new course of action that will seek to reform the tax structure, lighten the load on the Third Estate, and replenish the treasury. In this highly-volatile political landscape, delegates must work together to form creative solutions to France's fiscal nightmare.</p><br>
            
                </div>
                <div class="flex-child-topic">
                    <h3>Topic 2 - Voting and Political Reform</h3>
                    <p>The Age of Enlightenment, an intellectual movement that spawned notions of equality and universal rights, paves the way for Topic II to be discussed. Under Topic II, you must consider changes to the centuries-old French monarchy, including the enfranchisement of the Third Estate and a more equal distribution of power. Delegates must strive to balance perspectives from all estates while being mindful that the King ultimately holds the final decision on any proposed legislature: Any ideas that are considered too radical will not be approved. Delegates must address the unsustainable inequality that plagues the Ancien Regime without tipping it into anarchy.</p><br>

He is extremely passionate about Model UN, has attended all types of conferences, and is actively involved in his school club.

Music is a big part of Alex’s life, and he can be seen walking around Toronto and vibing to Hamilton, Lana Del Rey, and Kendrick Lamar. He has also enjoyed singing and playing the violin for many years and has been in all sorts of ensembles, including an acapella club, so feel free to walk up and start harmonizing with him! </p>

                            <p class="bio">After falling victim to MUN’s severely humbling yet rewarding experience in 2021, Sydney Yang has continued to raise placards ever since. She remains fascinated by debate’s cultivation of easily blind-spotted ideas. In other words, the attention brought to perspectives outside of poor takes on r/PoliticalCompassMemes. Neutrality and open-mindedness isn’t just a trait, but also a skill.

                                As an eleventh grader at Earl Haig Secondary School, she is proud to celebrate her third year of paying off sleep debt by listening to the pacifying lullaby of a teacher’s lecture. Sydney doesn’t discriminate in equally enjoying (and deeply deploring) many disciplines of study. Outside of school, she enjoys activities classified as “unproductive”, justifying it through “mental health” and “the prolonging of youth.” Meticulously manipulating her next Spotify Wrapped and revising half-baked fashion choices tops her agenda.
                                
                                Overall, Sydney looks forward to questionable arguments and even more questionable rebuttals.
