            <h2>Committee Description</h2>
            <p>The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) committee is a vital platform where delegates will address critical issues in global trade. The committee focuses on two key areas: trade imbalances and protectionism, and the green tech gap.</p><br>
            <p>Delegates will engage in discussions to understand the causes and consequences of trade imbalances. They will explore the impact of protectionist policies on domestic industries and global trade relations. Through dialogue and cooperation, delegates will work to promote fair trade practices while addressing national interests.</p><br>
            <p>Another crucial aspect of the committee's work is the bridging of the green tech gap. Delegates will examine the challenges faced by developing nations in accessing and adopting sustainable technologies. Through the lens of international cooperation, they will seek innovative strategies for technology transfer, sustainability promotion, and environmental protection.</p><br>
            <p>The UNCTAD committee offers delegates a platform to participate in lively debates, critical analysis, and diplomatic negotiations. It provides an opportunity to collaborate with peers from around the world, building bridges across diverse perspectives. By contributing to policy discussions and crafting comprehensive solutions, delegates will shape a more prosperous, fair, and sustainable global economy.</p><br><br>


            <div class="flex-container-topics">
                <div class="flex-child-topic">
                    <h3>Topic 1 - Trade Imbalances and Protectionism</h3>
                    <p>Trade imbalances and protectionism are pressing issues in the global trade landscape. Trade imbalances occur when there is a significant disparity between a country's imports and exports, leading to economic and geopolitical consequences. Protectionism refers to the adoption of measures that restrict international trade, such as tariffs and quotas, to protect domestic industries from foreign competition.</p><br>
                    <p>The significance of this topic lies in its potential to disrupt global economic stability and hinder the growth of developing nations. While protectionist policies aim to safeguard domestic industries, they can also lead to trade wars and retaliation from other countries, ultimately impacting global trade relations.</p><br>
                    <p>To address these challenges, delegates will explore potential solutions that strike a balance between protecting domestic industries and promoting open and fair trade. They will examine the role of international cooperation, the potential for alternative approaches, and the impact of protectionism on economic growth and development. By fostering constructive dialogue, delegates can work towards policies that promote sustainable and inclusive global trade.</p><br><br>
            
                </div>
                <div class="flex-child-topic">
                    <h3>Topic 2 - The Green Tech Gap</h3>
                    <p>The green tech gap represents the disparity in access to and adoption of green technologies between developed and developing nations. As the world faces increasing environmental challenges, the need to bridge this gap becomes crucial. Developed countries often possess greater resources and infrastructure to invest in and implement green technologies, while developing countries struggle to access and adopt them at scale.</p><br>
                    <p>This topic holds significant importance as it directly impacts environmental sustainability, economic growth, and global inequality. The green tech gap poses challenges for developing nations in addressing climate change, reducing carbon emissions, and achieving sustainable development goals.</p><br>
                    <p>Delegates will explore avenues for international cooperation to facilitate technology transfer, financing mechanisms, and capacity building to bridge the green tech gap. They will discuss policies that balance economic development needs with environmental sustainability, while addressing the challenges faced by developing nations in adopting green technologies.</p><br>
                    <p>By promoting the adoption of sustainable practices, fostering innovation, and ensuring equitable access to green technologies, delegates can contribute to a more sustainable and inclusive global economy.</p><br><br>

My journey into Model UN commenced in Grade 9, and since then, the exhilaration of collaboration and the opportunity to make new peers have been driving forces for me. Delving into spirited debates and navigating complex diplomatic scenarios are what truly ignited my passion for Model UN. Presently, I serve as the Vice President of AMHS Model UN, alongside having chaired the Toronto Model United Nations. Beyond the realm of MUN, I enjoy spending time with my one-eyed cat, indulging my caffeine addiction, binge-watching TV shows and reading. It is a pleasure to meet you!</p>

On top of MUN, she is the founder of her schoolâ€™s business club and enjoys competitive debate. When sheâ€™s not in committee, you can find her playing or listening to music, going for a walk, practicing yoga, or trying new food. Sheâ€™s probably working on a hundred projects right now, so feel free to ask her about one.</p>
