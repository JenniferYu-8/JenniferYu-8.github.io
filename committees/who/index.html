            <h2>Committee Description</h2>
            <p>The World Health Organization is a specialized agency that operates within the United Nations. It aims to improve health on an international scale, guided by values of universality of accessibility, ensuring quality of life, and international cooperation. The WHO has served to advance the world scientifically and medically since its conception. </p><br>
            <p>Delegates will discuss critical topics that challenge the social, economic, and political areas of modern healthcare. Furthermore, delegates must find ways to balance the perspectives of their respective member states and find viable solutions to pressing threats to human health and safety. As a result, delegates will cultivate an understanding of existing inequalities in global healthcare and how human wellbeing is fundamentally tied to global issues as a whole. </p><br><br>


            <div class="flex-container-topics">
                <div class="flex-child-topic">
                    <h3>Topic 1 - Antibiotic Resistance</h3>
                    <p>Under Topic 1, Antibiotic Resistance, delegates are tasked to craft a plan to defend the efficacy of a critical medical innovation. Delegates will first need to recognize and come to consensus on the sources of antibiotic resistance. Discussions will touch on the role of agricultural industries and how antibiotics are handled in food safety, as well as problematic patterns of antibiotic usage on an international scale. Delegates will consider and weigh the priorities of the WHO and identify where different needs and perspectives intersect, and where they conflict. With antibiotics and medicine being connected to a plethora of other issues, including economic development, international policy, and existing inequalities in society, delegates will need to debate the cost effectiveness of each solution. Embodying the goals of the WHO, delegates should work together to decide the best course of action in preventing resistance to antibiotics. </p><br><br>

                    <h3>Topic 2 - Neglected Tropical Diseases</h3>
                    <p>Under Topic 2, Neglected Tropical Diseases, delegates turn their attention towards an underrepresented, but dangerous set of conditions. Delegates will enhance their understanding of the intersection between health and the safety of resources such as clean water and sanitization. Additionally, they will discuss the challenges of eradicating NTDs, especially for the most vulnerable and impacted populations. Beyond physical health and wellbeing, delegates should consider how discrimination and stigma from NTDs impacts the lives of individuals. With NTDs being so deeply intertwined with global issues, delegates must take on the task of balancing a multitude of perspectives and needs. Delegates will face the challenges of the invisibility of these diseases, identify crucial stakeholders in the discussion, and collaborate with one another to tackle the topic of NTDs on an international level. </p><br><br>
