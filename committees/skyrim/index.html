            <h2>Committee Description</h2>
            <p>After the murder of the High King by Ulfric Stormcloak, and the first sighting of a dragon in over 1000 years, the province of Skyrim was plunged into chaos. Now, with no leader to unite the armies of the nine holds, Skyrim is at the mercy of the dragons, who carry with them a doomsday prophecy. To address the serious issues plaguing the province, Skyrim’s most knowledgeable and important individuals have been called to a round table meeting. Tensions are high as opposing political groups debate on the brink of civil war. The question is, will the delegates of the Council of Skyrim be able to put aside these differences for the greater good, or will this era of Skyrim’s history be its last?</p><br><br>

            <div class="flex-container-topics">
                <div class="flex-child-topic">
                    <h3>Topic A - The High King</h3>
                    <p>In 4E 201, Ulfric Stormcloak arrived at the Blue Palace in Solitude, Skyrim. There, using the power of Thu’um (aka the power of the Voice), he killed High King Torygg, solidifying himself as an enemy of the Empire. With no existing heir, the decision on who should be crowned the next High King or Queen has been left up to the Council of Skyrim. While Ulfric Stormcloak is adamant that his defeat of High King Torygg gives him the right to the throne, there are many others who are ready to fight tooth and nail to ensure he doesn’t take power. Furthermore, with Ulfric’s murder of the High King, tensions between his rebel faction, the Stormcloaks, and the Empire have reached an all-time high. If no agreement is met to quell this impending civil war, there won’t be anything left of Skyrim to rule.</p><br>

                <div class="flex-child-topic">
                    <h3>Topic B - Alduin the World Eater</h3>
                    <p>The Ruler of Dragons, Alduin the World Eater is old as the gods themselves. After a long and tyrannical rule in the early days of Skyrim, Alduin was defeated during the Dragon War through the use of an Elder Scroll. However, after over 1000 years of defeat, the leader of dragons has finally made his return. Alduin has begun travelling around the province, resurrecting his dragon army and attacking Skyrim’s civilians. It is believed that he intends to restore all the dragons of centuries past and reinstate his dictatorial rule over mankind. For years, no threat to Skyrim has loomed so large. The fate of both the province and the entire country of Tamriel, rests in the hands of The Council of Skyrim. Will they prevail, or will they again have to suffer the horrors of dragon rule?</p><br>
                </div>
                <div class="flex-child-topic">
                    <h3>Topic C - The Dragonborn</h3>
                    <p>The term Dragonborn is translated from the Dragon Language word "Dovahkiin", referring to a mortal being gifted with the powers of the dragons. This allows them to learn “Thu’um” incredibly quickly, and perform various magical feats such as breathing fire, calling lighting, and even becoming invincible for a short period of time. Furthermore, though the word “Dovahkiin” directly translates to Dragonborn, an alternate translation refers to the Dragonborn as “Born Hunter of Dragonkind”. This translation describes the Dragonborn’s role in most prophecies. To kill every last living dragon. This is done through the Dragonborn’s unique ability to consume the soul and knowledge of any dragon they defeat. Clearly, these abilities would be of great use to the Council of Skyrim as they attempt to defeat Alduin. But how can the delegates of the Council locate the Dragonborn, if they even exist at all? And can the Dragonborn be trusted to help, given their nearly infinite powers?</p><br>

These days, she luckily understands what she's doing most of the time, and has attended several conferences. Amelie also enjoys playing on the school volleyball team, practicing guitar, and attending ballroom dancing lessons. She also has a borderline obsessive interest in the following topics; The Hunger Games, The Black Plague, indie folk music, etc etc. Last year, she wrote and crisis-directed a Hunger Games JCC at MoMUN, Monarch Park's MUN conference.</p>
