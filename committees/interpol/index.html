            <h2>Committee Description</h2>
            <p>The International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol) is an intergovernmental organization consisting of  195 countries. Their main focus is to allow nations' police systems to work together to tackle global crime issues. The organization was founded on September 7 in 1923 and has tackled issues from global black market, to policing to Martines. Delegates should look forward to interesting debates and complex issues when participating in this committee. </p><br><br>

                <div class="flex-child-topic">
                    <h3>Topic 1 - Maritime Crimes</h3>
                    <p>As defined by Interpol, maritime crimes “are forms of piracy, kidnapping, armed robbery and other transnational crimes at sea causing an immediate threat to merchant vessels, seafarers, and trade’. Interpol has been working with local, regional and international bodies to develop global efforts to minimize maritime crimes on global waters. Piracy, armed robbery against ships and trafficking of goods and humans are serious threats affecting the global trade market and human safety. In this committee, you will debate, discuss and work towards solutions to minimize and prevent the effects of maritime crimes, focus on solutions to help prevent the economic and human costs of maritime crimes and work together to control the crimes committed on global waters. Delegates get ready to “sail away” to great debates and solutions throughout this committee!!</p><br>

                <div class="flex-child-topic">
                    <h3>Topic 2 - The Black Market </h3>
                    <p>The global black market is an “underground” illegal trade that involves the selling and buying of goods above fixed prices by other bodies. With the use of technology and online currencies such as “bitcoin” the underground economy is growing at a tremendous rate. Its impact on consumers, countries' economies and  businesses can be detrimental, as well as extremely dangerous to consumers and citizens. It is Interpol’s job to find new and proactive ways to minimize the dangers and use of the black market. Given the enormous size of the black market and underground economy, are delegates up for the challenge? Debating global systems to put an end to the market is vital for the success of the overall global economy. Delegates get ready to tackle some of the most famous yet secretive organized crime throughout this committee. Don’t let your solutions stay underground!</p><br>

After being pulled into a Model UN class by one of her friends, she fell in love with the activity and has been going to conferences ever since. Fictional crises are her favorite, but she's caught at multiple Ad Hoc's to avoid all the prep work. In her free time, she would be caught at the Mcdonald's near her school, which is THE hangout spot for her and her friends. She also enjoys swimming, going to the beach, and summer picnics (summer is the best month). As an avid Munner, she can't wait to meet new people who share the same interest in debate, politics, and diplomacy. </p>
