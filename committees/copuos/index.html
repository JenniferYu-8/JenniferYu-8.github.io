            <h2>Committee Description</h2>
            <p>COPUOS was established in 1959 as a United Nations specialised committee to examine various elements of outer space exploration and its applications for peaceful purposes.  The fundamental goals of the committee are to ensure the peaceful use of outer space, to create international collaboration in space exploration, to promote space technology for sustainable development, and to improve the safety and security of space activities. Recently, the rapid technological breakthroughs and expanding goals for outer space exploration have produced an urgent need for enhanced international collaboration. The emergence of new spacefaring nations, the proliferation of private space companies, and the development of cutting-edge technologies have broadened the horizons of human space activities, necessitating a collaborative effort to address the associated challenges and the legal and ethical implications of resource extraction beyond Earth. Delegates will have the opportunity to influence the future of space administration, promote responsible and sustainable practices, and harness the great potential that space has for the betterment of humanity in this Model UN committee.</p><br><br>

                    <h3>Topic 1 - Space Debris</h3>
                    <p>A major part of this committee includes addressing the urgent need to solve the growing problem of space debris, which endangers existing and future space missions. Potential collisions jeopardize functioning satellites, essential infrastructure, and space missions as the number of satellites and junk grows exponentially. When it comes to identifying effective methods to lessen this threat, delegates should explore new and emerging ideas such as space traffic management and active debris clearance to ensure that outer space exploration stays safe, and that those who are responsible are held accountable. </p><br>

                    <h3>Topic 2 - Space Exploration</h3>
                    <p>The Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) Model United Nations will address the critical problem of universal access to space and the equitable use of natural resources in space. The committee recognizes the growing interest in the exploitation of outer space resources, as well as the newfound global enthusiasm in space exploration aided by modern technology and its potential to benefit mankind as a whole. Delegates should explore how major countries may establish frameworks for cooperative missions and data exchange when participating in space exploration, as well as how legal boundaries might be established to ensure equal access to resources beyond Earth. </p><br>
